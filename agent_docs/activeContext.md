# Moodify - Active Context

## Current Task: File Structure Setup - COMPLETED ✅
Successfully created the complete file structure for the Moodify project with all required directories and empty component files.

## What I'm Working On Now
1. ✅ Created the core file structure as requested:
   - API layer for Spotify integration (`src/api/spotify.js`)
   - Component organization (cards, controls, layout)
   - Data layer for mood themes (`src/data/moodThemes.js`)
   - State management with Zustand (`src/store/useMoodStore.js`)
   - Component directories properly organized

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Created agent_docs directory with complete documentation
- ✅ Created all requested empty files:
  - `src/api/spotify.js`
  - `src/components/cards/PlaylistCard.jsx`
  - `src/components/controls/MoodSelector.jsx`
  - `src/components/layout/ThemeContainer.jsx`
  - `src/data/moodThemes.js`
  - `src/store/useMoodStore.js`

## Next Steps

2. ✅ Create requested file structure
3. ⏳ Ready for component implementation
4. ⏳ Ready for Spotify API integration setup
5. ⏳ Ready for mood-based theming system implementation

## Priority Focus
